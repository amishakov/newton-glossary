Description: How this whole thing works, plus a little bit of history surrounding the glossary.

Text:

The original idea behind the creation of the [Newton Glossary](/) was to provide a single, accessible resource for terminology related specifically to the Newton.

A significant number of the terms found in the glossary were initially compiled between 2001 and 2004 by [Grant Hutchinson](https://splorp.me/). Numerous [sources](/sources) were used, along with help from knowledgable folks such as [Paul Guyot](https://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](https://www.chuma.org/), and countless members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

Although it’s quite out of date, [Morgan Aldridge](http://www.makkintosshu.com/) has maintained a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).

At one point there was also a [Newton Book](/terms/newton-book) version of the glossary. We’ll see if we can make that happen again.

### Join The Fun!

### Colophon

This iteration of the glossary is formatted in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using plain text files and published with [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) — an extensible content management system built on PHP.

We run our stylesheets through [CSSLint](http://csslint.net/) because tidy code is better code … and we don’t mind getting our feelings hurt.

The entire project resides in a public [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/) repository, providing easy access for contributors, relatively pain-free upkeep, and peace of mind.

To add a bit of spit and polish to our Kirby experience, we use the following handy dandy plugins.
