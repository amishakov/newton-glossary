Description: How this whole thing works, plus a little bit of history surrounding the glossary.

----

Text:

The original idea behind the creation of the (link: / text: Newton Glossary) was to provide a single, accessible resource for terminology related to the [Apple Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton) platform.

A significant number of the terms found in the glossary were initially compiled between 2001 and 2004 by [Grant Hutchinson](https://splorp.com/). Numerous (link: /sources text: sources) were used, along with help from knowledgable folks such as [Paul Guyot](https://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](https://www.chuma.org/), and countless members of the [NewtonTalk](https://newtontalk.net/) community.

Although it’s quite out of date, [Morgan Aldridge](http://www.makkintosshu.com/) has maintained a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).

At one point there was also a (link: /terms/newton-book text: Newton book) version of the glossary. We’ll see if we can make that happen again.

### Join The Fun!

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and [pull requests](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/pulls) will be happily accepted. If possible, please use the project’s [issue tracker](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/issues) for any input you might have.

Before submitting new terms or suggestion corrections to existing entries, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the official (link: /style text: style guide) (which itself is a work in progress).

### Colophon

This iteration of the glossary is formatted in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using plain text files and published with [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) — an extensible content management system built on PHP.

We run our stylesheets through [CSSLint](https://csslint.net/) because tidy code is better code … and we don’t mind getting our feelings hurt.

The entire project resides in a public [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/) repository, providing easy access for contributors, relatively pain-free upkeep, and peace of mind.

To add a bit of spit and polish to our Kirby experience, we use the following handy dandy plugins.
