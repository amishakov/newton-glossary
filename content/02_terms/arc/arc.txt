Text:

A portion of the circumference of an (link: /terms/oval text: oval) bounded by a pair of radii joining at the oval’s center. Contrast this with a (link: /terms/wedge text: wedge), which includes part of the oval’s interior. Arcs and wedges are defined by the bounding (link: /terms/rectangle text: rectangle) that encloses the oval, along with a pair of angles marking the positions of the bounding radii.
