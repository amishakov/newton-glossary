Redundant Array of Inexpensive Newtons

Originally [coined by Ed Kummel](https://newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2002-February/0446.html), the acronym is a play on RAID or “Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks”, a storage system which makes use of multiple disk drives. RAIN can also refer to any collection of Newton devices where multiple copies of the same model exist.
