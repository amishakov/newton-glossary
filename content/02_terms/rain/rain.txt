Redundant Array of Inexpensive Newtons

Originally [coined by Ed Kummel](http://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&m=101293531830713&w=2), the acronym is a play on RAID or “Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks”, a storage system which makes use of multiple disk drives. RAIN can also refer to any collection of Newton devices where multiple copies of the same model exist.
