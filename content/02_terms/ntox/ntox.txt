A software (link: /terms/package text: package) that provides a simple (link: /terms/api text: API) for parsing (link: /terms/xml text: XML) and HTML data on a Newton device. Developed by (link: /sources/eckhart-koppen text: Eckhart KÃ¶ppen), ntox is based on the original [tox](http://40hz.org/tox/) tokenizer. Several applications, including the (link: /terms/courier text: Courier) web browser and the (link: /terms/raissa text: Raissa) RSS reader, require ntox to do their job.
