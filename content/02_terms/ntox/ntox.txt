A software [package](/terms/package) that provides a simple [API](/terms/api) for parsing [XML](/terms/xml) and HTML data on a Newton device. Developed by [Eckhart KÃ¶ppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen), ntox is based on the original [tox](http://40hz.org/tox/) tokenizer. Several applications, including the [Courier](/terms/courier) web browser and the [Raissa](/terms/raissa) RSS reader, require ntox to do their job.
