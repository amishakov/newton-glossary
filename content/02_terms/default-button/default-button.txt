Text:

A (link: /terms/button text: button) or (link: /terms/close-box text: close box) in a (link: /terms/slip text: slip) that is differentiated by heavy black lines above and below the button. This visual distinction only appears in (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) 2.1 when a physical keyboard such as the (link: /terms/newton-keyboard text: Newton keyboard) is connected to the Newton device.

Pressing the Return key on the keyboard performs the same action as (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) a default button.
