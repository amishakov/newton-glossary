Text:

Software developed by [Makoto “Gnue” Nukui](/sources/gnue) to translate between Unicode and other text encoding schemes used by various languages and computer platforms.

[Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) stores text as UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) which may need to be translated to another encoding scheme in order for the text to be exchanged with other systems.

Newton Text Encoding provides a modular approach for extending the language support of an [application](/terms/application).

For example, [SimpleMail](/terms/simplemail) uses optional text encoding modules to natively support languages such as Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, Czech, Finnish, Hungarian, German, Polish, and Russian.

Also referred to as [NTE](/terms/nte) and [NTEncoding](/terms/ntencoding).
