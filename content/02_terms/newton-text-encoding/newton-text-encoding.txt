Text:

Software developed by (link: /sources/gnue text: Makoto “Gnue” Nukui) to translate between Unicode and other text encoding schemes used by various languages and computing platforms.

(link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) stores text as UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) which can be translated to another encoding scheme in order for the text to be exchanged with other systems.

Newton Text Encoding provides a modular approach for extending the language support of an (link: /terms/application text: application).

For example, (link: /terms/simplemail text: SimpleMail) uses optional text encoding modules to natively support languages such as Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, Czech, Finnish, Hungarian, German, Polish, and Russian.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/nte text: NTE) and (link: /terms/ntencoding text: NTEncoding).
