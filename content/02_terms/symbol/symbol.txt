An (link: /terms/object text: object) used as an identifier. (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) uses symbols to name (link: /terms/variable text: variables), (link: /terms/class text: classes), (link: /terms/message text: messages), and frame (link: /terms/slot text: slots). You can also use symbols as simple identifying values, as you would use enumerated types in other languages.
