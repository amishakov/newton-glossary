Text:

A (link: /terms/picker text: picker) designed to simplify the process of specifying a numerical value by (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the digits of the number itself. Tapping the top half of a digit increases the numerical value and tapping the bottom half of a digit decreases the value.

The number picker was designed to replicate a “mechanical digital” (link: /terms/alarm text: alarm) clock with its “(link: /terms/flipping-digits text: flipping digits)”.

There are specialized number pickers for specifying dates and times.
