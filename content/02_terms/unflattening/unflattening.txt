Text:

The process of converting a stream of bytes from a soup [entry](/terms/entry) into a frame [object](/terms/object). An example of this conversion occurs when installing a [package](/terms/package) on a Newton device. The reverse of this process is [flattening](/terms/flattening).

Colloquially known as [unflattenation](/terms/unflattenation).
