Text:

A self-described "meta-project" created by (link: /sources/steven-frank text: Steven Frank) to explore (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) software and hardware through basic emulation. The primary goal of Green was to help understand and document the way that the (link: /terms/einstein text: Einstein) emulator behaved, then using that information to hopefully help contribute to the existing open source project.
