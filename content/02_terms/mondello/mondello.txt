The alternate code name of the software-based [print recognizer](print-recognizer) system developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/). Originally known as [Rosetta](/terms/rosetta), the name was changed to Mondello after receiving a cease-and-desist request from the developers of the [Rosetta Smalltalk](http://esug.org/data/HistoricalDocuments/Misc/RosettaSmalltalk.pdf) project. Although never used publicly, the official product name for the print recognizer was [Neuropen](/terms/neuropen).
