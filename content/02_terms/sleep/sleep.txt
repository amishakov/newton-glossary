Sleep is also a section found in the (link: /terms/prefs text: Prefs) application.

In the Sleep (link: /terms/slip text: slip), the user can specify the period of time until a Newton device automatically turns itself off, whether or not the device sleeps when plugged into a power adapter, as well as when to turn off the (link: /terms/backlight text: backlight).
