A file that resides in the same folder as the (link: /terms/newton-toolkit text: Newton Toolkit) application containing (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) code that you want available in any (link: /terms/project text: project), hence the (link: /terms/global text: global) designation. It is compiled each time you launch the Newton Toolkit (link: /terms/application text: application).
