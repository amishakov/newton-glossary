An unreleased successor to the (link: /terms/rough-disarm text: Rough Disarm) disassembler created by (link: /sources/paul-guyot text: Paul Guyot). This version of the (link: /terms/macintosh-programmers-workshop text: Macintosh Programmers Workshop) (MPW) tool is reportedly more complex and relies on copyrighted source code to operate.
