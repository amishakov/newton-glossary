Software developed by an elusive fellow named Bob Anderson as an alternative to Appleâ€™s own (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilities) (NCU). It allowed users to (link: /terms/backup text: backup), (link: /terms/restore text: restore), browse data, and install (link: /terms/package text: packages) on their Newton devices. The software was never officially released and the author has subsequently disappeared.

Also known variously as (link: /terms/nbe text: NBE), (link: /terms/nbx text: NBX), and (link: /terms/newtbx text: NewtBX).
