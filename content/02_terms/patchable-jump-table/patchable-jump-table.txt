Date: 31 May 2001

Text:

A series of branching instructions directly pointing to native (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) functions. These instructions are ordered differently depending on the version of the (link: /terms/rom text: ROM). This (link: /terms/jump-table text: jump table) can be partially replaced by (link: /terms/system-patch-pages text: system patch pages), allowing (link: /terms/system-patch text: system patches) to replace specific (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating system) functions.
