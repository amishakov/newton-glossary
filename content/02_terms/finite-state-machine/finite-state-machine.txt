Text:

A collection of states, [events](/terms/event), [actions](/terms/action), and transitions between states defined in software as a [function](/terms/function). This function takes the current state and a specific input event and returns a new set of output events along with the next state. [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) uses a finite state machine to simplify the design of communication-based applications which manage both the [endpoint](/terms/endpoint) and the related user interaction.

Also referred to as [FSM](/terms/fsm) or [State Machine](/terms/state-machine).
