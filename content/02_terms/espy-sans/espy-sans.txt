Text:

A sans serif bitmap (link: /terms/font text: font) used when defining text in a (link: /terms/book-source-file text: book source file) that will be processed with (link: /terms/newton-book-maker text: Newton Book Maker) or (link: /terms/newton-toolkit text: Newton Toolkit). It is also a font that can be specified when creating a (link: /terms/newton-book text: Newton book) with the (link: /terms/newton-press text: Newton Press) software.

The Espy Sans font on Mac OS is the equivalent to the (link: /terms/system text: System) font on (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS).

There is also an (link: /terms/easter-egg text: easter egg) located in earlier versions of (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) that reveals a “secret” version of the Espy Sans font.

The easter egg is activated by writing “Remember toothpaste” in the (link: /terms/notepad text: Notepad) application, (link: /terms/highlight text: highlighting) the text, and (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the (link: /terms/assist text: Assist) button. “Toothpaste” will be added to the (link: /terms/to-do-list text: To Do List) using Espy Sans rather than the default font.

The easter egg does not work in Newton OS 2.0 and later.
