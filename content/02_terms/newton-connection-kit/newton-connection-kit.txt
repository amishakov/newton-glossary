Text:

A consumer product developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) that included the [Newton Connection](/terms/newton-connection) software, a serial cable, and related documentation for connecting Newton devices to Mac OS and Windows computers, allowing the user to exchange and [synchronize](/terms/synchronize) information with common desktop [applications](/terms/application).

When first released, there were two versions of the Newton Connection Kit. The original Newton Connection Kit provided the means to backup data and install packages. The [Newton Connection Pro Kit](/terms/newton-connection-pro-kit) added support for data import and export. The two products were later combined into a single kit to eliminate confusion.

The Newton Connection Kit is for use with earlier versions of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os). The equivalent software package for Newton OS 2.0 and later is [Newton Connection Utilities](/terms/newton-connection-utilities).

Also referred to as [NCK](/terms/nck).
