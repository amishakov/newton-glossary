A consumer product developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) that included the (link: /terms/newton-connection text: Newton Connection) software, a serial cable, and related documentation for connecting Newton devices to Mac OS and Windows computers, allowing the user to exchange and (link: /terms/synchronize text: synchronize) information with common desktop (link: /terms/application text: applications).

When first released, there were two versions of the Newton Connection Kit. The original Newton Connection Kit provided the means to backup data and install packages. The (link: /terms/newton-connection-pro-kit text: Newton Connection Pro Kit) added support for data import and export. The two products were later combined into a single kit to eliminate some confusion.

The Newton Connection Kit is for use with earlier versions of (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS). The equivalent software package for Newton OS 2.0 and later is (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilities).

Also referred to as (link: /terms/nck text: NCK).
