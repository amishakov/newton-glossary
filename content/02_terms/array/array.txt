In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), a sequence of numerically indexed (link: /terms/slot text: slots) that contain (link: /terms/object text: objects). The first element is indexed by zero. Like other nonimmediate objects, an array can have a user-specified (link: /terms/class text: class), and can have its length changed dynamically.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/array-elements text: Array Elements).
