This information includes the name of the card and what type of card it is, such as a [storage card](/terms/storage-card) or modem. If the card is a storage card, additional information is displayed including used storage space, available storage space, whether or not there is a [backup](/terms/backup) stored on the card, and whether or not the card is locked or [write-protected](/terms/write-protected).

The card slip can also be used to rename a storage card, as well as [backup](/terms/backup), [restore](/terms/restore), and erase information stored on the card, providing the cardâ€™s [write protection switch](/terms/write-protection-switch) is in the unlocked position.
