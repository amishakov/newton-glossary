Newton devices produced by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) include the Apple ROM Extension ((link: /terms/rex text: REx)) as the initial extension. The Apple REx contains most of the built-in Newton OS (link: /terms/application text: applications). For example, on an (link: /terms/emate-300 text: eMate 300) the REx contains (link: /terms/newton-works text: Newton Works). ROM extensions can also define various hardware features, such as system timing, memory specifications, and code.

Devices using a licensed version of Newton OS usually include the Apple REx along with a vendor-specific, custom ROM extension.

Up to four ROM extensions can be included on an (link: /terms/n2 text: N2) platform device.
