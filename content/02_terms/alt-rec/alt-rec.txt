An [extension](/terms/extension) written by [Paul Guyot](/sources/paul-guyot) that improves the [handwriting recognition](/terms/handwriting-recognition) engine built into [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os). This rather awkwardly named software takes into account several parameters, including [dictionary](/terms/dictionary) contents, to change the weight of the suggestions made by the current [recognizer](/terms/recognizer) and makes alternate suggestions.
