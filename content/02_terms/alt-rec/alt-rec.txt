Text:

An (link: /terms/extension text: extension) written by (link: /sources/paul-guyot text: Paul Guyot) that improves the (link: /terms/handwriting-recognition text: handwriting recognition) engine built into (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS). This rather awkwardly named software takes into account several parameters, including (link: /terms/dictionary text: dictionary) contents, to change the weight of the suggestions made by the current (link: /terms/recognizer text: recognizer) and makes alternate suggestions.
