Text:

The sequence of sounds made by a Newton device when (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) several times in succession. Although these sounds seem random, it has been documented that they are actually a repeating sequence of (link: /terms/click text: clicks) that vary in tone, likely an intentional (link: /terms/easter-egg text: easter egg).

According to some people, the sequence is similar to an infamous (link: /terms/oscar-meyer-theme text: Oscar Meyer Theme), the same company known for its [Wienermobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wienermobile). This would explain the reference to a hot dog.

Others think the sequence sounds more like the instrumental song “Popcorn” popularized by the band [Hot Butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Butter) in 1972.
