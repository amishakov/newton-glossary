Rich Site Summary _or_ Really Simple Syndication

A standardized, multipurpose distribution and syndication format based on (link: /terms/xml text: XML). RSS is primarily used by websites to provide a (link: /terms/feed text: feed) of frequently updated information such as blog entries, news headlines, or podcasts. A feed contains text, links, and other (link: /terms/metadata text: metadata), such as the date of publication and the author’s name.

Feeds can be subscribed to using a news reader or aggregator (link: /terms/application text: application). On a Newton device, RSS can be viewed using Eckhart Köppen’s (link: /terms/raissa text: Raissa) or (link: /terms/courier text: Courier) applications.
