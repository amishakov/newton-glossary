A term coined by [Anton Balaban](/sources/anton-balaban) to describe the process of using the Russian language on a Newton device. Russification generally involves installing Cyrillic [fonts](/terms/font), a special [keyboard](/terms/keyboard) layout, [system patches](/terms/system-patch) to modify various bits of text, and other software [packages](/terms/package) to localize the English language version of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os).

Once a Newton device has gone through this process, it is said to have been [Russified](/terms/russified).
