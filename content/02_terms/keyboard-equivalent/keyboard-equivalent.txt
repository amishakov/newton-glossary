Text:

A command entered using a physical keyboard that produces the same action as (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) a specific (link: /terms/button text: button) or choosing an item from a (link: /terms/picker text: picker). For example, typing a (link: /terms/key-combination text: key combination) consisting of the “Command” key and the “P” key produces the equivalent of selecting the “Print” action in most (link: /terms/application text: applications).

Holding down the “Command” key on a keyboard connected to a (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) 2.1 device displays a (link: /terms/slip text: slip) listing all of the keyboard equivalents available for the current application.
