Personal Computer Memory Card International Association

An international organization founded in 1989 to establish standards for integrated circuit cards and to promote interchangeability among mobile computing platforms. PCMCIA is also used to describe the type of removable (link: /terms/pc-card text: PC cards) used by Newton devices for storage, connectivity, and other peripherals.

Colloquially referred to as _People Canâ€™t Remember Computer Industry Acronyms_ because of its rather lengthy nature.
