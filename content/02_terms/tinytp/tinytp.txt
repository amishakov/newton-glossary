Tiny Transport Protocol

A lightweight communications (link: /terms/protocol text: protocol) that lies on top of the (link: /terms/irlmp text: IrLMP) layer. It provides transportation for large messages using flow control and a packet handling process known as segmentation and reassembly. The (link: /terms/ircomm text: IrCOMM) communications protocol layer is built on the (link: /terms/tinytp text: TinyTP) transport.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/irtinytp text: IrTinyTP).
