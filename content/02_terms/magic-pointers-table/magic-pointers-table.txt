Text:

A series of NewtonScript (link: /terms/pointer text: pointers) that indicate the location of various (link: /terms/object text: objects). This table can be partially replaced by (link: /terms/system-patch-pages text: system patch pages), allowing a (link: /terms/system-patch text: system patch) to replace specific (link: /terms/magic-pointer text: magic pointers).
