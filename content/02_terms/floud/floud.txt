Frank’s Law of Unexpected Disappearances

An explanation of how physical items or past events can suddenly disappear from your perceived reality. The items or events somehow slip into a time that has been shifted a few milliseconds relative to the time someone is currently experiencing. This theory was first [proposed by Frank Gründel](https://newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2020-July/019084.html) on the [NewtonTalk](/terms/newtontalk) mailing list and may explain why broken things (such as Newton devices) often start working again the next time you use them.
