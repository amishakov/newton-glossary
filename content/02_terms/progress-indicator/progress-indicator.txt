Text:

A (link: /terms/user-interface text: user interface) element appearing in a (link: /terms/status-slip text: status slip) that communicates operation progress. The (link: /terms/indicator text: indicator) can be displayed as a (link: /terms/barber-pole-gauge text: barber pole gauge), which animates a set of diagonal stripes during the current operation, but does not indicate how much of the operation has been completed. A progress indicator can also quantify the progress of the current operation, displaying a (link: /terms/bar-gauge text: bar gauge) that indicates relative completeness of the current operation as a shaded portion of the entire gauge.
