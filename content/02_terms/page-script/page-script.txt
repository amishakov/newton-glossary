Text:

A piece of (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) code attached to a (link: /terms/layout text: layout) in a (link: /terms/newton-book text: Newton book) source file. As an example, (link: /terms/script text: scripts) can be used to draw a different background or handle special (link: /terms/pen text: pen) events pertaining to a content item or page. The actions defined in (link: /terms/content-script text: content scripts) override those in page scripts, just as page scripts take precedence over (link: /terms/book-script text: book scripts).
