Text:

A tool developed by (link: /sources/paul-guyot text: Paul Guyot) for the (link: /terms/macintosh-programmers-workshop text: Macintosh Programmers Workshop) (MPW) development environment, facilitating the disassembly of (link: /terms/arm text: ARM) processor code found in the (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) ROM. Described by its author as a “quick hack” — at least when compared to the more polished, but unreleased (link: /terms/better-disarm text: Better Disarm) tool.
