A project instigated by [David Arnold](/sources/david-arnold) with the goal of developing an emulator inspired by the [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) using the Python programming language.

GNUton was originally conceived to be a part of an open source development environment consisting of a virtual machine, storage architecture, templates for general [operating system](/terms/operating-system) features and [user interface](/terms/user-interface) elements, and support for executing native [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript).
