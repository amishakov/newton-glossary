Text:

An (link: /terms/easter-egg text: easter egg) in (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) that displays the names of members of the Newton development team. The easter egg is activated by writing “About Newton” in the (link: /terms/notepad text: Notepad) application, (link: /terms/highlight text: highlighting) the text, and (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the (link: /terms/assist text: Assist) button.

In Newton OS 1.0, the list of names is followed by a tribute to the late Newton engineer (link: /terms/ko-isono text: Ko Isono).

In Newton OS 2.0 and later, the names of the development team are displayed as a series of randomized phrases in the (link: /terms/assist-slip text: assist slip), starting with _“What about Newton?”_ and followed by entries such as _“What about larryy?”_ … a reference to (link: /sources/larry-yaeger text: Larry Yaeger).

On German language Newton devices, writing (link: /terms/uber-newton text: Über Newton) produces the same easter egg.
