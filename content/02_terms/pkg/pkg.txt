Text:

The (link: /terms/filename-extension text: filename extension) used to identify Newton (link: /terms/package-file text: package files). Confusingly, a number of other (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating systems) including Solaris, BeOS, Mac OS X, and iOS also use the .pkg extension to denote installable software packages. To avoid interoperability issues, it has been suggested that Newton package files use the (link: /terms/newtonpkg text: .newtonpkg) filename extension on current operating systems.
