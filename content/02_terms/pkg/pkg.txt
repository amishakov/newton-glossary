The [filename extension](/terms/filename-extension) used to identify Newton [package files](/terms/package-file). Confusingly, a number of other [operating systems](/terms/operating-system) including Solaris, BeOS, Mac OS X, and iOS also use the `.pkg` extension to denote installable software packages. To avoid interoperability issues, it has been suggested that Newton package files use the `.newtonpkg` filename extension on current operating systems.
