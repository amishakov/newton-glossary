The code name of the larger, unreleased (link: /terms/messagepad text: MessagePad) device also known as the (link: /terms/newton-plus text: Newton Plus). The debugger (link: /terms/rom text: ROM) for the (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000) and (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100) devices was referred to as the “Senior Cirrus Debug”, perpetuating the theory that the Newton Plus actually existed and ended up being developed as the MessagePad 2000.
