The code name of the larger, unreleased (link: /terms/messagepad text: MessagePad) device also known as the (link: /terms/newton-plus text: Newton Plus). The debugger (link: /terms/rom text: ROM) for the (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000) and (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100) devices was referred to as the “Senior Cirrus Debug”, perpetuating the theory that the Newton Plus actually existed and ended up being developed as the MessagePad 2000.

Also referred to as the (link: /terms/a4-newton text: A4 Newton) or (link: /terms/a4-slate text: A4 Slate) due to its dimensions being similar to a standard sheet of paper.
