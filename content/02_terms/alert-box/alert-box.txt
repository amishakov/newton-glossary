There are two types of alert boxes.

A (link: /terms/notification-alert text: notification alert) conveys information that is useful to the user but does not present any “far-reaching” consequences such as a loss of data. Some notification alerts have a (link: /terms/snooze-button text: snooze button), which enables a user to temporarily dismiss the alert.

A (link: /terms/confirmation-alert text: confirmation alert) requires the user confirm or cancel an action that can have “far-reaching” consequences. For example, a confirmation alert appears before erasing the data on a (link: /terms/storage-card text: storage card).
