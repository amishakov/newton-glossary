Text:

[Double-tapping](/terms/double-tapping) a word pops up the correction picker, displaying a list of alternate words the user can select as a replacement. The bottom of the correction picker contains a [keyboard button](/terms/keyboard-button), a [corrector button](/terms/corrector-button), and a [Try Letters](/terms/try-letters) button.

Tapping “Try Letters” causes the Newton system to ignore the recognition dictionaries and try to recognize the word [letter-by-letter](/terms/letter-by-letter). Tapping the keyboard button displays a [typewriter](/terms/typewriter) keyboard, to allow the user to type corrections. Tapping the [corrector button](/terms/corrector-button) brings up a [corrector view](/terms/corrector-view), in which the user can make corrections to individual letters.

Tapping a letter in the corrector view pops up a different correction picker, listing alternate letters as well as commands to insert and delete individual characters.
