The last Newton device released by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) through their [Newton Inc.](/terms/newton-inc) subsidiary. It shared the same specifications as its predecessor, the [MessagePad 2000](/terms/messagepad-2000), with the exception of an increased amount of [system memory](/terms/system-memory). A MessagePad 2000 device can been upgraded to the equivalent of a MessagePad 2100 by increasing the total amount of [RAM](/terms/ram) from 5MB to 8MB.

Like its predecessor, the MessagePad 2100 was code named alternately [N2](/terms/n2) and [Q](/terms/q).

It is commonly referred to as an [MP2100](/terms/mp2100).
