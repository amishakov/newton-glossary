Advanced RISC Machines

The company formed out of a joint venture between British computer manufacturer Acorn, Apple, and processor manufacturer (link: /terms/vlsi text: VLSI Technology). ARM produced (link: /terms/risc text: RISC) processors used in Newton devices.

Early (link: /terms/messagepad text: MessagePad) devices use a 20 MHz ARM 610 processor, whereas the (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000) and (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100) devices use a more powerful 160 MHz (link: /terms/strongarm text: StrongARM) processor. The (link: /terms/emate-300 text: eMate 300) uses a 25 MHz ARM 710a processor.

The ARM architecture was originally dubbed the Acorn RISC Machine.
