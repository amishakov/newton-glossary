A project instigated by (link: /sources/charles-mangin text: Charles Mangin) which modified a (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000) to create “a rounder, more friendly” device with a bright white finish.

Later on the iNewt project evolved into the concept of modifying a MessagePad case to enclose an iPhone.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/the-great-white-newt text: The Great White Newt) and (link: /terms/inewton text: iNewton).

iNewt is also a tongue in cheek reference to the rumoured [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) tablet computer prior to the introduction of what would become known as the iPad.
