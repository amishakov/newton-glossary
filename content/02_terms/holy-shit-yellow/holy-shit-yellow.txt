The colour of some of the mechanical components located in the battery compartment of early Newton devices as described by [Landon Dyer](/sources/landon-dyer). The bright yellow colour of the locking mechanism would theoretically “scare people into being cautious” and discourage the simultaneous removal of both the main power source and the [backup battery](/terms/backup-battery).
