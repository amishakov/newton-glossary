A mailing list dedicated to the discussion of the Newton platform and other related products.

Founded in 1997 by Sean Oâ€™Shaughnessy, the list was taken over by (link: /terms/planet-newton text: Planet Newton) in 1999 until a catastrophic server failure in 2001. That same year, (link: /sources/victor-rehorst text: Victor Rehorst) took over the list administration duties, subsequently [handing over the reigns](https://newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2007-March/0808.html) to (link: /sources/grant-hutchinson text: Grant Hutchinson) in 2003.

The list is commonly referred to as (link: /terms/ntlk text: NTLK).
