An (link: /terms/application text: application) serving as a central repository for all incoming and outgoing data handled by the (link: /terms/routing text: routing) and (link: /terms/transport text: transport) interfaces. The InOut Box application is specifically part of (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) 2.0 and later, whereas earlier versions of Newton OS utilize separate applications for the (link: /terms/in-box text: In Box) and (link: /terms/out-box text: Out Box).

If the InOut Box application is hidden and new items are received, a (link: /terms/notify-button text: notify button) that looks like a (link: /terms/blinking-star text: blinking star) will appear at the top of the screen. (link: /terms/tapping text: Tapping) the (link: /terms/star text: star) allows the user to open the InOut Box.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/inout text: InOut).
