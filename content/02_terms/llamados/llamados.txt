Text:

A software package of dubious utility which provides an alternate input interface for system management on a Newton device, somewhat mimicking the command line environment of MS-DOS. The name references (link: /terms/llama text: Llama), the unofficial mascot of the Appleâ€™s (link: /terms/developer-technical-services text: Developer Technical Services) team within the (link: /terms/newton-systems-group text: Newton Systems Group).
