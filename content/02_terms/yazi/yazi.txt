Yet Another Z Interpreter

A text adventure engine developed by (link: /sources/scrawl-software text: Scrawl Software) which reads (link: /terms/package text: packages) containing source data, allowing you to play classic games such as Zork, Planetfall, and Enchanter on a Newton device.

The YAZI (link: /terms/application text: application) is a (link: /terms/bytecode text: bytecode) interpreter for games written using the Zork Implementation Language (ZIL) which shares similarities with the (link: /terms/lisp text: LISP) programming language.
