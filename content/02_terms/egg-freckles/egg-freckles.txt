An [easter egg](/terms/easter-egg) found in [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 which when activated displays an image from a [Doonesbury comic strip](https://web.archive.org/web/20170629100722/http://doonesbury.washingtonpost.com/strip/set/24) lampooning the accuracy of the early Newton [handwriting recognition](/terms/handwriting-recognition).
