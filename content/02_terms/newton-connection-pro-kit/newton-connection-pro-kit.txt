Text:

A short lived version of the (link: /terms/newton-connection-kit text: Newton Connection Kit) developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) for connecting Newton devices to Mac OS and Windows computers.

Whereas the original Newton Connection Kit was designed to simply backup data and install software (link: /terms/package text: packages), the Newton Connection Pro Kit also provided support for data import and export. The two products were later combined into a single kit to eliminate some confusion.
