The hardware independent instructions that are interpreted when a [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript) function executes.

Also defined as an intermediate language that requires a runtime program for execution. For example, NewtonScript is compiled into bytecode before being interpreted and executed by the [NSM](/terms/nsm) virtual machine.

Also referred to as [Byte Code](/terms/byte-code) in some Newton programming documentation.
