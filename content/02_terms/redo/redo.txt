The opposite of [undo](/terms/undo), a system wide feature built into [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 for cancelling the last action performed by a user. In most situations, [tapping](/terms/tapping) the Undo [icon](/terms/icon) in the [button bar](/terms/button-bar) will revert the most recent action, such as entering text or erasing a [sketch](/terms/sketch). On Newton OS 2.0 devices, tapping the Undo icon again will redo the original action.
