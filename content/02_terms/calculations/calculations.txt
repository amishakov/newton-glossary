When a new calculations document is created, it is assigned the default title “(link: /terms/untitled-calculations text: Untitled Calculations)”, which can be changed in the (link: /terms/title slip text: title slip).

For some reason, the Calculations stationery is called (link: /terms/graphical-calculations text: Graphical Calculations) in the title slip.
