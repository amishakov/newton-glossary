A time management and personal productivity system developed by author and consultant David Allen in 2001. Also known as [GTD](/terms/gtd), the system is based on efficiently storing, tracking, and retrieving information related to tasks that are to be accomplished.

According to [Eckhart Köppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen), this type of task management is perfectly suited to the [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) platform. To prove this, Köppen developed two pieces of Newton software specifically supporting the concepts of GTD, [Flashpoint](/terms/flashpoint) and [Nitch](/terms/nitch).
