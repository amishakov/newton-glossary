A segment of memory containing addresses translated by the (link: /terms/memory-management-unit text: memory management unit) (MMU). A page consists of a group of bytes considered indivisible by the MMU. The MMU for the (link: /terms/arm text: ARM) processor divides the memory into sections of 1 MB, which can then be divided into pages of 4 KB and 64 KB.
