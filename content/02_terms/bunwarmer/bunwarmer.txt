Affectionate nickname for some of the first Newton development prototypes. So called because of their flat design and heat they generated, similar to the [coffee decanter warmers](https://web.archive.org/web/20140829081634/http://www.bunn.com/images/products/jpg/06310.0004_WX2.jpg) manufactured by the [Bunn-O-Matic Corporation](https://www.bunn.com/).

Also referred to as (link: /terms/bunn-warmer text: Bun Warmer) and (link: /terms/bunn-warmer text: Bunn Warmer).
