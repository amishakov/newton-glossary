An [application](/terms/application) created by [Flash Sheridan](http://flash-sheridan.name/) which facilitated ordering custom burritos from [La Costena](https://web.archive.org/web/19981206120424/http://www.costena.com/) located in Mountain View, California. The user would specify various options for their burrito using a [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) device and then [beam](/terms/beam), email, or fax the order to the restaurant.

Burrito Beamer was reverse engineered from the original “burrito” PostScript program written by Ross Thompson of Adobe Systems.
