Text:

A value representing a non-physical location for a piece of data. The microprocessor (and hence the programs) do not access data at the (link: /terms/physical-address text: physical) location in memory, but at the virtual location, which can be translated into the physical location by the (link: /terms/memory-management-unit text: memory management unit) (MMU).
