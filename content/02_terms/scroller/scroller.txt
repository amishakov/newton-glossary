A set of icon-based (link: /terms/button text: buttons) that allow the user to (link: /terms/scroll text: scroll) horizontally or vertically through an area of content that is larger than the current (link: /terms/view text: view). Several different scroller configurations are used in (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS), generally consisting of up/down and left/right arrows.

The function of a scroller is not connected to the function of the (link: /terms/scroll-arrows text: scroll arrows) located on the (link: /terms/button-bar text: button bar).
