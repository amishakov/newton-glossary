A set of icon-based [buttons](/terms/button) that allow the user to [scroll](/terms/scroll) horizontally or vertically through an area of content that is larger than the current [view](/terms/view). Several different scroller configurations are used in [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os), generally consisting of up/down and left/right arrows.

The function of a scroller is not connected to the function of the [scroll arrows](/terms/scroll-arrows) located on the [button bar](/terms/button-bar).
