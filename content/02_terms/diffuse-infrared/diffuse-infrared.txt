A method of wireless communication where a hardware transmitter floods an area with (link: /terms/infrared text: infrared) signals that bounce off local surfaces such as the ceiling, walls, and furniture in a room.

Because the infrared signal is scattered, computers and other devices with infrared receivers do not require a direct line of sight with the transmitter. Similarly, a person moving around in the same area will not interfere with the signal. Since most of the infrared light transmitted never actually reaches a receiver, diffuse infrared is not known for its power efficiency.

Phototonics Corporation developed a product called Cooperative that consisted of hardware a (link: /terms/transceiver text: transceiver) which provided diffuse (link: /terms/infrared-appletalk text: infrared AppleTalk) connections between Mac OS computers, Newton devices, and other peripherals.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/diffuse-ir text: Diffuse IR).
