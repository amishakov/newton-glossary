Text:

A method of wireless communication where a hardware transmitter floods an area with [infrared](/terms/infrared) signals that bounce off local surfaces such as the ceiling, walls, and furniture in a room.

Because the infrared signal is scattered, computers and other devices with infrared receivers do not require a direct line of sight with the transmitter. Similarly, a person moving around in the same area will not interfere with the signal. Since most of the infrared light transmitted never actually reaches a receiver, diffuse infrared is not known for its power efficiency.

Phototonics Corporation developed a product called Cooperative that consisted of hardware a [transceiver](/terms/transceiver) which provided diffuse [infrared AppleTalk](/terms/infrared-appletalk) connections between Mac OS computers, [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) devices, and other peripherals.

Also known as [Diffuse IR](/terms/diffuse-ir).
