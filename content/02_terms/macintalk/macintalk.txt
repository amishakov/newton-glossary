The speech synthesizer component of the Newton [text-to-speech](/terms/text-to-speech) software. MacinTalk provides a flexible [codec](/terms/codec) which converts [recognized text](/terms/recognized-text) into spoken audio. The synthesized speech can be controlled through various parameters such as voice type, speaking rate, volume, and pitch.

MacinTalk first appeared as part of the operating system in the original Macintosh, hence the name.
