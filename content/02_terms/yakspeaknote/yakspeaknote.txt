A (link: /terms/package text: package) that works in conjunction with (link: /terms/yak text: Yak) to provide a way to send (link: /terms/recognized-text text: recognized text) to the (link: /terms/text-to-speech text: text-to-speech) engine via the (link: /terms/routing-button text: routing button) in the (link: /terms/notepad text: Notepad) application.

YakSpeakNote was developed by (link: /sources/matej-horvat text: Matej Horvat) as a replacement for the original (and rather buggy) (link: /terms/noteyak text: NoteYak) software.
