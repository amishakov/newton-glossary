Card Information Structure

Information stored on a [PCMCIA](/terms/pcmcia) card that describes the formatting and organization of the data on the [card](/terms/card). This can include the type of card, the supported power requirements and power saving capabilities, as well as the manufacturer and model number of the card.

When a [PC card](/terms/pc-card) is unrecognized by a device, it is often due to the CIS information being missing or damaged.
