Text:

An [application](/terms/application) used to control various settings on an [eMate 300](/terms/emate-300) when itâ€™s in [Classroom Mode](/terms/classroom-mode). Teacher Setup lets you select a default printer, enable or disable spell-checking, allow multiple users to log into an eMate, as well as choose which applications users are able to access. It also provides a means to enter users and associated passwords on each eMate.

The settings specified using Teacher Setup can be used to make up a [base classroom state](/terms/base-classroom-state), settings that are common to all eMate devices in a classroom. Once you set a base classroom state on a single eMate, you can transfer those settings to other eMate devices using a [storage card](/terms/storage-card).
