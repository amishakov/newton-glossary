Text:

An [alert box](/terms/alert-box) that appears on the [screen](/terms/screen) requiring the user confirm or cancel an action that may have “far-reaching” consequences. For example, a confirmation alert appears before erasing the data on a [storage card](/terms/storage-card).

A confirmation alert has no [close box](/terms/close-box). Instead, it has labeled buttons, usually named “Cancel” and “OK”.

Also referred to as a [confirmation slip](/terms/confirmation-slip).
