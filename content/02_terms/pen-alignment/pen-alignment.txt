A measure of how accurate the use of the (link: /terms/pen text: pen) is when interacting with the (link: /terms/screen text: screen) of a Newton device. For example, when (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the screen, if a (link: /terms/tap text: tap) affects an area of the screen that is not directly under the tip of the pen, then the user needs to (link: /terms/realign text: realign) the pen.
