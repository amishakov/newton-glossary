Text:

A piece of (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) code attached to a content item in a (link: /terms/newton-book text: Newton book) source file, before any (link: /terms/book-maker-commands text: Book Maker commands). The actions defined in content scripts override those in (link: /terms/page-script text: page scripts), just as page scripts take precedence over (link: /terms/book-script text: book scripts).
