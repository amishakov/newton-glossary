Text:

A condition affecting the (link: /terms/display-area text: display area) of a Newton, where (link: /terms/object text: objects) and text on the (link: /terms/screen text: screen) are excessively jaggy or irregular. This is related to the position of the (link: /terms/pen text: pen) being misinterpreted. One theory suggests that jaggies are caused by either an electro-mechanical problem between the (link: /terms/screen text: screen) and the connector or dirt between the display surface and the surrounding (link: /terms/bezel text: bezel).
