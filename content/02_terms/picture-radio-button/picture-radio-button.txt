Text:

A Newton-specific [radio button](/terms/radio-button) control that displays its state — either on or off — and is part of a group in which the user can [select](/terms/select) only one [button](/terms/button) at a time. A [picture](/terms/picture) next to each button in the group indicates the control’s current setting. Compare this to a [checkbox](/terms/checkbox) group, where more than one button can be selected at a time.
