Text:

A Newton-specific (link: /terms/radio-button text: radio button) control that displays its state — either on or off — and is part of a group in which the user can (link: /terms/select text: select) only one (link: /terms/button text: button) at a time. A (link: /terms/picture text: picture) next to each button in the group indicates the control’s current setting. Compare this to a (link: /terms/checkbox text: checkbox) group, where more than one button can be selected at a time.
