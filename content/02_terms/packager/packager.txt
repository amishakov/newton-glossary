Text:

A utility used to set the correct file type and creator for Newton (link: /terms/package text: packages) when used on a Mac OS X computer. By default, any file with a `.pkg` (link: /terms/filename-extension text: filename extension) associates that file with the Mac OS X installer (link: /terms/application text: application). Packager processes a (link: /terms/package-file text: package file) so it is recognized with another (link: /terms/application text: application) such as (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilites).

A packager is also a software development tool used to create Newton packages from (link: /terms/compiled text: compiled) source code.
