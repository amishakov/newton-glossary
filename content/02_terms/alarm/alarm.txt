A section found in the (link: /terms/prefs text: Prefs) application.

In the Alarm (link: /terms/slip text: slip), the user can set the type of sound used for the minute timer and (link: /terms/calendar text: calendar) alarms. The daily alarm has its own sound and cannot be changed. The user can also specify other settings such as the (link: /terms/volume text: volume) for all alarms, whether the system volume overrides the alarm volume, and whether (link: /terms/persistent-alarms text: persistent alarms) are enabled.
