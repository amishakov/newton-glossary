Reportedly, the last version of the NuBus-based Newton development card that facilitated the running of a Newton development environment on a Mac OS (link: /terms/desktop-computer text: desktop computer).

The ARMadillo card was preceded by the (link: /terms/armageddon text: ARMageddon) and (link: /terms/armistice text: ARMistice) cards. The cards were so named because of the (link: /terms/arm text: ARM) processor used in the Newton hardware.
