Text:

[Tapping](/terms/tapping) the [corrector button](/terms/corrector-button) in the [correction picker](/terms/correction-picker) brings up a corrector view, in which the user can make corrections to individual letters. The user can write over a letter to replace it, delete a letter by scrubbing it, or insert a space in which to write an additional letter.

Tapping a letter in the corrector view pops up a different correction picker, listing alternate letters as well as commands to insert and delete individual characters.
