A condition where the (link: /terms/heap text: heap) used to allocate memory in C++ code (the (link: /terms/c-heap text: C++ heap)) is the same area being used by (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) for system related (link: /terms/objects text: objects) (the (link: /terms/system-heap text: system heap)). When this area of memory is overwritten, the heap becomes (link: /terms/corrupted text: corrupted) or modified, requiring the Newton device to be (link: /terms/reset text: reset).
