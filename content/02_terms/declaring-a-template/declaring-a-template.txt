Text:

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), registering a (link: /terms/template text: template) in another (link: /terms/view text: view) (usually its (link: /terms/parent text: parent)) so that the template view is preallocated when the other view is opened. This allows access to (link: /terms/method text: methods) and (link: /terms/slot text: slots) in the declared view.
