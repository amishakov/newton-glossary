Text:

A visually distinct (link: /terms/newton-user-interface text: Newton user interface) element consisting of a border made up of short, slanted lines edged by a thin black rectangle. A striped border indicates a (link: /terms/view text: view) known as a routing slip.

Itâ€™s no accident that this border looks similar to the border traditionally printed on airmail envelopes, as routing slips are analogous to postal envelopes.
