An (link: /terms/easter-egg text: easter egg) hidden in (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) that schedules a (link: /terms/meeting text: meeting) in the (link: /terms/date-book text: Date Book) titled “(link: /terms/apple-assurance text: Apple Assurance)" on the closest upcoming Friday.

To activate this easter egg, the (link: /terms/getting-started-card text: Getting Started card) must be inserted into a (link: /terms/messagepad text: MessagePad) device running Newton OS . In the (link: /terms/notepad text: Notepad) application, write “schedule Happy Hour Fri”, then (link: /terms/tap text: tap) the (link: /terms/assist text: Assist) button.

Back in the day, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) was apparently known for its Friday afternoon “bashes”.
