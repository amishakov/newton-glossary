Text:

A later version of the NuBus-based card that facilitated the running of a Newton development environment on a Mac OS [desktop computer](/terms/desktop-computer). Whereas the previous [ARMageddon](/terms/armageddon) card connected to an external circuit board that replicated the physical Newton hardware, the ARMistice card was a self-contained “Newton on a board.”

Produced in 1993, the ARMistice card preceded the [ARMadillo](/terms/armadillo) card. The cards were so named because of the [ARM](/terms/arm) processor used in the Newton hardware.
