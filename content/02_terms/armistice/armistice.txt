A later version of the NuBus-based card that facilitated the running of a Newton development environment on a Mac OS (link: /terms/desktop-computer text: desktop computer). Whereas the previous (link: /terms/armageddon text: ARMageddon) card connected to an external circuit board that replicated the physical Newton hardware, the ARMistice card was a self-contained “Newton on a board.”

Produced in 1993, the ARMistice card preceded the (link: /terms/armadillo text: ARMadillo) card. The cards were so named because of the (link: /terms/arm text: ARM) processor used in the Newton hardware.
