Text:

An input [container view](/terms/container-view) that is displayed if the [Assist](/terms/assist) function can’t interpret a user’s written request, allowing the user to provide more information. The user can choose an [action](/terms/action) from the slip’s [Please picker](/terms/please-picker) and can write on the slip’s [input line](/terms/input-line).

If the user wrote something before [tapping](/terms/tapping) the Assist button, such as a [request word](/terms/request-word], but did not provide enough information to clearly specify an action, the Assist slip displays those words and includes a message prompting the user to provide additional information.

The Assist slip is also referred to as the [Assist Drawer](/terms/assist-drawer) in some Apple documentation, even though it is not technically a [drawer](/terms/drawer).
