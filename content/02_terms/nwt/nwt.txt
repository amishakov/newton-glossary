The file extension used to identify attachments sent using [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) email [applications](/terms/application) such as [SimpleMail](/terms/simplemail) or [EnRoute](/terms/enroute), as well as a [Newton Connection](/terms/newton-connection) data synchronization [workfile](/terms/workfile). Each workfile has a set of associated [backup files](/terms/backup-file) with the extension `.nb#`, where `#` represents a number from 1 to 9.

`nwt` is also a command line [application](/terms/application) created by [Eckhart KÃ¶ppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen) that provides package management, data synchronization, and data export for a Newton device. This utility is part of the [RDCL](/terms/rdcl) (Ruby Desktop Connection Library) framework.
