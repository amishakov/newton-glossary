Compact Desktop Connection Library

A experimental distribution of the (link: /terms/dcl text: DCL) communication framework and (link: /terms/k-libs text: K Libs) libraries created by (link: /sources/eckhart-koppen text: Eckhart KÃ¶ppen). The cDCL provides a subset of the functionality of the original, which includes connecting to and interacting with data stored on devices running (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) 2.0 and later via the built-in (link: /terms/dock text: dock) protocol.
