Compact Desktop Connection Library

A experimental distribution of the [DCL](/terms/dcl) communication framework and [K Libs](/terms/k-libs) libraries created by [Eckhart KÃ¶ppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen). The cDCL provides a subset of the functionality of the original, which includes connecting to and interacting with data stored on devices running [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 and later via the built-in [dock](/terms/dock) protocol.
