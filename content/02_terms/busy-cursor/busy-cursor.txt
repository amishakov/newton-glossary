The busy cursor is not meant to provide complete feedback during a lengthy operation. If an [application](/terms/application) or [transport](/terms/transport) begins an operation that may take more than a few seconds to complete, it will usually display a [status slip](/terms/status-slip) instead.

Colloquially known as the [lightbulb icon](/terms/lightbulb-icon) or the [somethingâ€™s happening icon](/terms/somethings-happening-icon).
