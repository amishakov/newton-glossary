Often represented by an (link: /terms/icon text: icon) of a watch or clock on other (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating systems), the busy cursor in (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) is represented by an depiction of the Newton logo.

The busy cursor is not meant to provide complete feedback during a lengthy operation. If an (link: /terms/application text: application) or (link: /terms/transport text: transport) begins an operation that can take more than a few seconds to complete, it will usually display a (link: /terms/status-slip text: status slip) instead.

Colloquially referred to as the (link: /terms/lightbulb-icon text: Lightbulb Icon) or the (link: /terms/somethings-happening-icon text: Somethingâ€™s Happening Icon).
