Text:

A [storage card](/terms/storage-card) that allows a user to update a Newton device with essential [packages](/terms/package), [drivers](/terms/driver), and [system patches](/terms/system-patch) without the need for a serial connection to another computer. A bootstrap card facilitates the installation of these packages by [restoring](/terms/restore) information from the card, replacing information on the destination Newton. Packages are retrieved by accessing the [InOut Box](/terms/inout-box) application located in the [Extras Drawer](/terms/extras-drawer) and then selecting [put away](/terms/put-away) using the [tag picker](/terms/tag-picker).

This process is known as [bootstrapping](/terms/bootstrapping).

Also referred to as a [lender card](/terms/lender-card) or [loaner card](/terms/loaner-card).
