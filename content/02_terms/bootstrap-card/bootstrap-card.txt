Text:

A (link: /terms/storage-card text: storage card) that allows a user to update a Newton device with essential (link: /terms/package text: packages), (link: /terms/driver text: drivers), and (link: /terms/system-patch text: system patches) without the need for a serial connection to another computer. A bootstrap card facilitates the installation of these packages by (link: /terms/restore text: restoring) information from the card, replacing information on the destination Newton. Packages are retrieved by accessing the (link: /terms/inout-box text: InOut Box) application located in the (link: /terms/extras-drawer text: Extras Drawer) and then selecting (link: /terms/put-away text: put away) using the (link: /terms/tag-picker text: tag picker).

This process is known as (link: /terms/bootstrapping text: bootstrapping).

Also referred to as a (link: /terms/lender-card text: Lender Card) or (link: /terms/loaner-card text: Loaner Card).
