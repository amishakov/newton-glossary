Text:

A special type of (link: /terms/immediate text: immediate) value. In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), there is only one boolean, called `true`. (link: /terms/function text: Functions) and control structures use (link: /terms/nil text: nil) to represent `false`. When testing for a value, `nil` represents `false`, and any other value is equivalent to `true`.
