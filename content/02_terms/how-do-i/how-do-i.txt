The (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) includes a (link: /terms/help-browser text: help browser) for built-in applications and system services. Users can view the onscreen help by (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the “How Do I?” (link: /terms/button text: button) in the (link: /terms/assist-slip text: Assist slip). When a user taps the button, an outline-like overview of help topics is displayed. Tapping a topic expands the outline to display that topic’s subtopics or, if that topic has no subtopics, it will display instructions for that topic.
