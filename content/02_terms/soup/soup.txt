Date: 24 May 2001

Text:

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), a persistently stored (link: /terms/object text: object) that contains a series of (link: /terms/frame text: frames) called (link: /terms/entry text: entries). Like a (link: /terms/database text: database), a soup has indexes that are used to access entries in a sorted order. One aspect of a soup that sets it apart from an object oriented database is the “smart” (link: /terms/flattening text: flattening) of entries before they are added to the soup.

Also referred to as a (link: /terms/data-soup text: Data Soup), (link: /terms/object-store text: Object Store), or (link: /terms/persistant-object-database text: Persistant Object Database).
