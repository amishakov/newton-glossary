Text:

In [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript), a [container view](/terms/container-view) that presents several discrete subviews arranged vertically, one above the other. The [roll](/terms/roll) can be viewed in [overview](/terms/overview) mode, where each subview is represented by a single-line description. Any single subview or all subviews can be expanded to full size.

The built-in [Notepad](/terms/notepad) application uses a roll view, allowing users to [scroll](/terms/scroll) through multiple items.

Also referred to as a [Paper Roll](/terms/paper-roll) and [Roll](/terms/roll).
