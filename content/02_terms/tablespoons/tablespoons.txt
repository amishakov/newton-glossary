A mangled translation of “Jabberwocky”. When (link: /sources/robert-mcnally text: Robert McNally) entered Lewis Carroll’s famous poem into an original Newton device, the (link: /terms/handwriting-recognition text: handwriting recognition) generated what was basically a new lyric poem, with “Tablespoons” as its title.
