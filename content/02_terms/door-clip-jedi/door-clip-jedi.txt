A term coined by Mark Ross on the [NewtonTalk](/terms/newtontalk) mailing list describing person who has developed a solution for repairing or replacing a [lid clip](/terms/lid-clip) on a [MessagePad 2000](/terms/messagepad-2000) or [MessagePad 2100](/terms/messagepad-2100) device.

For some reason, the hinged [lid](/terms/lid) found on most Newton devices is regularly (and mistakenly) referred to as a [door](/terms/door) on the [NewtonTalk](/terms/newtontalk) mailing list, hence the use of the phrase “door clip”.
