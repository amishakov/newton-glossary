A semiconductor with an electrical resistance that changes in response to temperature. A thermistor is used in conjunction with a (link: /terms/polyswitch text: polyswitch) in rechargeable (link: /terms/battery-pack text: battery packs) to prevent (link: /terms/charging text: charging) the (link: /terms/cell text: cells) if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.

Thermistors can be found in battery packs used in (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000), (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100), and (link: /terms/emate-300 text: eMate 300) devices.
