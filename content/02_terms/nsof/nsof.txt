Newton Streamed Object Format

A specific type of data which describes a NewtonScript [frame](/terms/frame) along with everything that it contains. [Stream files](/terms/stream-file) are encoded using [NSOF](/terms/nsof). Examples of files containing NSOF data include [.nwt](/terms/nwt) attachments sent using [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) email [applications](/terms/application) such as [SimpleMail](/terms/simplemail) or [EnRoute](/terms/enroute), as well as most [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit) documents.

`nsof` is also a command line [application](/terms/application) created by [Eckhart KÃ¶ppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen) that encodes and decodes NSOF data as part of the [RDCL](/terms/rdcl) (Ruby Desktop Connection Library) framework.
