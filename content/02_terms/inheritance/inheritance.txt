Text:

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), the mechanism by which attributes ((link: /terms/slot text: slots) or data) and behaviours ((link: /terms/method text: methods)) are made available to (link: /terms/object text: objects). (link: /terms/parent text: Parent) inheritance allows (link: /terms/view text: views) of dissimilar types to share slots containing data or methods. Prototype inheritance allows a (link: /terms/template text: template) to base its definition on that of another template or (link: /terms/prototype text: prototype).
