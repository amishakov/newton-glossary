Text:

A collection of code that allows developers of (link: /terms/application text: applications) for desktop (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating systems) to directly (link: /terms/synchronize text: synchronize) data between their applications and a Newton device.

A (link: /terms/dil text: DIL) is a slightly modified version of the code that exists in desktop applications such as (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilities), (link: /terms/newton-package-installer text: Newton Package Installer), and (link: /terms/newton-press text: Newton Press). DILs allow you to connect via communication protocols such as [TCP/IP](/terms/tcp-ip), (link: /terms/irda text: IrDA), and (link: /terms/adsp text: ADSP) to Mac OS and Windows computers. Specifically, DILs facilitate the encoding and decoding of data via the Newton Streamed Object Format ((link: /terms/nsof text: NSOF)).

(link: /terms/newton-data-browser text: Newton Data Browser) is an example of a DIL-based program.
