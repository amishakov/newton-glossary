A button located in some (link: /terms/notification-alert text: notification alerts) which enables the user to temporarily dismiss the alert.

For example, if an (link: /terms/alarm text: alarm) or reminder (link: /terms/alert-box text: alert box) is displayed, the user can postpone the alarm for a specific number of minutes. Tapping the “Snooze” button displays a list of times in the (link: /terms/snooze-picker text: snooze picker). Selecting a time from the list will dismiss (or (link: /terms/snooze text: snooze)) the alert for that amount of time.
