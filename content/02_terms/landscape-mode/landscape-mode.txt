Text:

When the content on the (link: /terms/screen text: screen) of a Newton device is displayed in a horizontal (link: /terms/orientation text: orientation). The opposite of landscape mode is (link: /terms/portrait-mode text: portrait mode).

The orientation can be changed by (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) the (link: /terms/rotate-button text: Rotate Button).

Not all (link: /terms/application text: applications) support landscape mode and will display a (link: /terms/notification-alert text: notification alert) prompting you to return the screen to portrait mode.
