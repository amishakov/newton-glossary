In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), a (link: /terms/frame text: frame) on the (link: /terms/function-call-stack text: function call stack) that describes a (link: /terms/function text: function) that has not yet completed execution. A stack activation record contains a (link: /terms/pointer text: pointer) to the next instruction to be executed. Specifically, the function’s (link: /terms/receiver text: receiver) and (link: /terms/implementor text: implementor) — if they exist — and the function’s associated parameters, temporary variables, and named (link: /terms/variable text: variables).
