Text:

A [frame](/terms/frame) on the [function call stack](/terms/function-call-stack) that describes a [function](/terms/function) that has not yet completed execution. A stack activation record contains a [pointer](/terms/pointer) to the next instruction to be executed. Specifically, the function’s [receiver](/terms/receiver) and [implementor](/terms/implementor) — if they exist — and the function’s associated parameters, temporary variables, and named [variables](/terms/variable).
