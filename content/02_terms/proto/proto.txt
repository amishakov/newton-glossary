Text:

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), a (link: /terms/frame text: frame) referenced through another frame’s `_proto` (link: /terms/slot text: slot). With regard to (link: /terms/view text: views), a proto is not intended to be directly (link: /terms/instantiate text: instantiated) — you (link: /terms/reference text: reference) the proto from a (link: /terms/template text: template). The system supplies several view protos (or (link: /terms/proto-template text: proto templates)), which an (link: /terms/application text: application) can use to implement (link: /terms/user-interface text: user interface) elements such as (link: /terms/button text: buttons) and (link: /terms/input-area text: input areas).

Also referred to as a (link: /terms/prototype text: Prototype).

Proto was also the original name of (link: /terms/prota text: Prota), an alternate implementation of (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) developed by (link: /sources/walter-smith text: Walter Smith).
