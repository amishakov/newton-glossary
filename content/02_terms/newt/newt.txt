An affectionate nickname for a Newton device.

Newt was also the nickname of the scaled back development project that formed after the (link: /terms/dylan text: Dylan) programming language failed to be a viable means to develop the Newton (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating system).

Steve Weyer’s (link: /terms/newtdevenv text: NewtDevEnv) application development framework also goes by the name of Newt.
