An affectionate nickname for a Newton device.

Newt was also the nickname of the scaled back development project that formed after the [Dylan](/terms/dylan) programming language failed to be a viable means to develop the Newton [operating system](/terms/operating-system).

Steve Weyer’s [NewtDevEnv](/terms/newtdevenv) application development framework also goes by the name of Newt.
