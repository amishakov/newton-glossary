Text:

Every (link: /terms/container-view text: container view) is framed by a border. A view border serves to demarcate what is contained within the (link: /terms/view text: view) and what is not. If a view fills the entire screen, its border is not visible.

Different border styles identify special types of container views. For example, a (link: /terms/wavy-border text: wavy border) is associated with an (link: /terms/alert-box text: alert box), whereas a (link: /terms/striped-border text: striped border) is used to indicate a (link: /terms/routing-slip text: routing slip).
