Text:

Every [container view](/terms/container-view) is framed by a border. A view border serves to demarcate what is contained within the [view](/terms/view) and what is not. If a view fills the entire screen, its border is not visible.

Different border styles identify special types of container views. For example, a [wavy border](/terms/wavy-border) is associated with an [alert box](/terms/alert-box), whereas a [striped border](/terms/striped-border) is used to indicate a [routing slip](/terms/routing-slip).
