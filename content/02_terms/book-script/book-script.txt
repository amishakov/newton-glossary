Text:

A piece of (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) code defined at the beginning of a (link: /terms/newton-book text: Newton book) source file, before any content or (link: /terms/book-maker-commands text: Book Maker commands). These (link: /terms/script text: scripts) are made available throughout the entire Newton book via parent (link: /terms/inheritance text: inheritance). The actions defined in (link: /terms/content-script text: content scripts) override those in (link: /terms/page-script text: page scripts), just as page scripts take precedence over book scripts.
