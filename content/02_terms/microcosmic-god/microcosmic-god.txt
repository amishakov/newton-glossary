The job title appearing on the business card of (link: /sources/larry-yaeger text: Larry Yaeger) when he was part of the Advanced Technology Group within [Apple](https://www.apple.com/).

_“Microcosmic God”_ is the title of a science fiction story written in 1941 by American author [Theodore Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon). The story is an early example of the “pocket universe” concept used in science fiction, hence its adoption by Yaeger while working on the Newton project.
