An image of a closed lock used to indicate that data contained on a (link: /terms/store text: store) or in a (link: /terms/soup text: soup) entry is located on a write-protected (link: /terms/storage-card text: storage card), (link: /terms/application-card text: application card), or is being displayed in a read-only (link: /terms/view text: view).

For example, a (link: /terms/card-slip text: card slip) will display a locked icon if the (link: /terms/write-protection-switch text: write-protection switch) on a storage card is in the locked position.

Also referred to as a (link: /terms/locked-switch-icon text: Locked Switch Icon).
