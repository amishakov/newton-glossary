A service that provided the ability to send messages via telephone, fax, or computer equipped with a modem using a personal 800 number. The user would receive notification of incoming faxes, voicemail, email, and text messages on a [PageCard](/terms/pagecard) inserted into their Newton device, PowerBook laptop, or other compatible computer.

The Apple Notification Service was part of the [Apple Mobile Message System](/terms/apple-mobile-message-system) and was replaced by the [SWiMS](/terms/swims) service provided by [Socket Communications](https://web.archive.org/web/19980208233349/http://www.socketcom.com/), makers of the PageCard.
