An early development environment for [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) created by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) that consisted of [Macintosh Common Lisp](/terms/macintosh-common-lisp), a compiler for the [Ralph](/terms/ralph) programming language, and other tools.

Leibniz is also an emulator for [Runt](/terms/runt)-based Newton devices currently being developed by [Steve White](/sources/steve-white).
