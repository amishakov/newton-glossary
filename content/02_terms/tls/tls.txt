Transport Layer Security

A security (link: /terms/protocol text: protocol) used to create encrypted connections over a network. Originally proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)), TLS is based on and supersedes the (link: /terms/ssl text: SSL) protocol.

TLS is used in Paul Guyotâ€™s adaptation of the (link: /terms/mbed-tls text: Mbed TLS) library, enabling Newton (link: /terms/application text: applications) such as the (link: /terms/mail-v text: Mail V) email client to use secure (link: /terms/imap text: IMAP) to communicate with mail servers.
