The MessagePad 2000 is based on the (link: /terms/strongarm text: StrongARM) 110 processor, making it nearly ten times as fast as its predecessor, the (link: /terms/messagepad-130 text: MessagePad 130). It also featured significantly more (link: /terms/ram text: RAM), a slightly larger greyscale (link: /terms/screen text: screen), support for two (link: /terms/pcmcia text: PCMCIA) cards, and the proprietary multifunction (link: /terms/newton-interconnect text: Newton InterConnect) port.

When an MessagePad 2000 has been upgraded to the equivalent specifications of a (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100), it becomes an (link: /terms/ump text: UMP) or “Upgraded MessagePad”. A non-upgraded MessagePad 2000 is also referred to as an (link: /terms/original-messagepad-2000 text: Original MessagePad 2000) or (link: /terms/omp2k text: OMP2K).

Like its successor, the MessagePad 2000 was code named alternately (link: /terms/n2 text: N2) and (link: /terms/q text: Q).

It is commonly referred to as an (link: /terms/mp2000 text: MP2000).
