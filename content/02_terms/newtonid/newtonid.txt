Text:

A free utility developed by [Adam Tow](/sources/adam-tow) that generates a universal identifier for Newton devices running [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 and later. NewtonID provides developers a means of creating software registration systems that do not rely on information that may change, such as the [owner](/terms/owner) or the serial number of the Newton device.
