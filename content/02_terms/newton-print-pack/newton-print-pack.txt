Developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), the Newton Print Pack was originally a serial to parallel adapter with built-in, (link: /terms/rom text: ROM)-based drivers that allowed a user to print from a Newton device to various desktop printers. A later version of the Newton Print Pack was entirely based in software and could be used with third-party adapters and cables.

Also referred to as (link: /terms/print-pack text: Print Pack) and (link: /terms/npp text: NPP).
