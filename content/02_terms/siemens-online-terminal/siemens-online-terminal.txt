A prototype device developed by [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/) that was positioned as an “all-in-one communication terminal” employing a [user interface](/terms/user-interface) based on [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) and combining several communication services including wireless telephony, fax, voice messaging, web access, and email. Siemens also developed the [NotePhone](/terms/notephone) which combined a telephone and fax modem with the equivalent of an [Original MessagePad](/terms/original-messagepad).

A third-party device that utilizes a licensed version of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) is commonly referred to as a [clone](/terms/clone).
