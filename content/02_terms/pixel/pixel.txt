Text:

Originally, a contraction of the words “picture” and “element”. The smallest dot a device can draw on the [screen](/terms/screen). On a Newton [MessagePad](/terms/messagepad), there are 80 pixels to an inch. Each pixel can be either black or white, so it can be represented by a single bit. Thus, the image displayed is referred to as a [bitmap](/terms/bitmap).
