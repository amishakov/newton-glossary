Text:

A (link: /terms/character-key text: character key) located on a keyboard that moves the (link: /terms/caret text: caret) or (link: /terms/insertion-point text: insertion point).

In a (link: /terms/field text: field) that allows entering multiple lines of text, the Return key ends the current paragraph and moves the caret to the beginning of the next line. In a field that allows entering one line of text, the Return key moves the caret to the next field or (link: /terms/input-line text: input line) in the same (link: /terms/container-view text: container view).

The Return key on a physical keyboard performs the same action as (link: /terms/tapping text: tapping) a (link: /terms/default-button text: default button).
