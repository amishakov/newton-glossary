A type of (link: /terms/flash-card text: flash card) storage developed by [SanDisk](https://www.sandisk.com/). A (link: /terms/cf-card text: CF card) is about one third the size of a (link: /terms/pc-card text: PC card) and uses a 50-pin subset of the (link: /terms/pcmcia text: PCMCIA) connector standard. CompactFlash also contains an (link: /terms/ata text: ATA) controller and can appear to the host device as if it was an external disk.

A CompactFlash card can be used as a (link: /terms/storage-card text: storage card) on a Newton device in conjunction with Paul Guyotâ€™s (link: /terms/ata-support text: ATA Support) driver.
