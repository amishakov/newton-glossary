Infrared Data Association

An industry body developing standards for (link: /terms/infrared text: infrared) data transfer.

IrDA is also the infrared communications (link: /terms/protocol text: protocol) used in later Newton devices, including the (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000), (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100), and (link: /terms/emate-300 text: eMate 300).

The IrDA standard consists of a hardware (link: /terms/serial-infrared text: serial infrared) (SIR) interface specification, a link access protocol specification ((link: /terms/irlap text: IrLAP)), a link management protocol specification ((link: /terms/irlmp text: IrLMP)) and a transport protocol specification ((link: /terms/tinytp text: TinyTP)).
