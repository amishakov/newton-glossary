Text:

An (link: /terms/application text: application) created by (link: /sources/eckhart-koppen text: Eckhart Köppen) that facilitates the organization of projects, subprojects, and associated actions or tasks based on the (link: /terms/getting-things-done text: Getting Things Done) productivity system. Whereas Köppen’s (link: /terms/nitch text: Nitch) makes use of the built-in (link: /terms/notepad text: Notepad) application to provide similar functionality, Flashpoint is a self-contained application.
