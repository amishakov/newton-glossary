An [application](/terms/application) created by [Eckhart Köppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen) that facilitates the organization of projects, subprojects, and associated actions or tasks based on the [Getting Things Done](/terms/getting-things-done) productivity system. Whereas Köppen’s [Nitch](/terms/nitch) makes use of the built-in [Notepad](/terms/notepad) application to provide similar functionality, Flashpoint is a self-contained application.
