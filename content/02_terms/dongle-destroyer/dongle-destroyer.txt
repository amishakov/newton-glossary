A physical modification made to a (link: /terms/messagepad-2000 text: MessagePad 2000) or (link: /terms/messagepad-2100 text: MessagePad 2100) device by installing a custom circuit board or internal serial adapter. The modification adds a standard (link: /terms/mini-din text: Mini-Din) serial port alongside the proprietary (link: /terms/newton-interconnect text: Newton InterConnect) port. So named because it eliminates the need for a (link: /terms/dongle text: dongle) such as the (link: /terms/newton-serial-adapter text: Newton Serial Adapter). After modification, only one of the serial ports can be used at a time.

An example of a dongle destroyer is the (link: /terms/ser-001 text: SER-001) serial port replacement designed by (link: /sources/david-humphreys text: David Humphreys).
