The code name for the first speculative, pen-based (link: /terms/tablet-computer text: tablet computer) conceived by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/). The device was planned to utilize three (link: /terms/hobbit text: Hobbit) processors, a hard drive, an active matrix (link: /terms/lcd text: LCD) display, and (link: /terms/infrared text: infrared) networking.

Figaro went through two design concept stages, settling on a design which was code named (link: /terms/mont-blanc text: Mont Blanc). A working hardware prototype based on the Mont Blanc design was code named (link: /terms/cadillac text: Cadillac).

When the Figaro project eventually transitioned into what would become the Newton project, it was split into three sizes of device: the tablet-sized (link: /terms/newton-plus text: Newton Plus), a mid-sized device simply known as Newton, and the smaller (link: /terms/pocket-newton text: Pocket Newton).
