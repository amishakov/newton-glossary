The Northwest of Us

Established in 1991, The Northwest of Us was the largest Macintosh user group in Illinois, after splitting away from the Chicago based Macintosh user group _The Rest of Us_.

The group maintained several (link: /terms/special-interest-group text: special interest groups), including one specifically focused on Newton users. The Newton (link: /terms/sig text: SIG) eventually transformed into a group covering a broader range of mobile computing and handheld devices.

In 2015, the group changed its name to the _Suburban Chicago Apple Users_.
