Text:

An early (link: /terms/lisp text: Lisp)-based version of (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) using the (link: /terms/ralph text: Ralph) programming language and a “hacked up” development environment called (link: /terms/leibniz text: Leibniz). Work on Bauhaus began around the same time as the (link: /terms/junior text: Junior) hardware project, which would eventually become the (link: /terms/original-messagepad text: Original MessagePad). The Bauhaus project was cancelled in 1994.
