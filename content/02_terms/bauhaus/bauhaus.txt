An early [Lisp](/terms/lisp)-based version of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) using the [Ralph](/terms/ralph) programming language and a “hacked up” development environment called [Leibniz](/terms/leibniz). Work on Bauhaus began around the same time as the [Junior](/terms/junior) hardware project, which would eventually become the [Original MessagePad](/terms/original-messagepad). The Bauhaus project was cancelled in 1994.
