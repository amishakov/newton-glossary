At one time, The Newted Community provided email accounts, web hosting, message boards, chat services, and technical support. It also featured a section called the [Soupbox](/terms/soupbox), containing articles, reviews, and opinion pieces from members of the community. The site currently provides an archive of information and support resources for Newton users.
