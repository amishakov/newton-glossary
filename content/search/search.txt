Text:

The search function looks for complete word combinations.

For example, searching for “(link: /search?q=routing+slip text: routing slip)” will only return items that contain that exact combination of words.

If you are not getting adequate results, try using fewer terms in your search.

For example, searching for “(link: /search?q=routing text: routing)” will return all items containing that word, including “routing slip”.

You do not need to use quotes around search terms.
