Text:

### Abbreviations (used as a “see also” pointing at expanded term)

Only include the abbreviated term in the related terms of the expanded term. Do not include the abbreviated term in other terms.

For example, [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit) should list [NTK](/terms/ntk) as a related term because it is the actual abbreviation for [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit).

However, [project build](/terms/project-build) should list [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit), not [NTK](/terms/ntk).

### Abbreviations (more common than the expanded term)

For example, [PCMCIA](/terms/pcmcia) is an acronym that is more commonly used than its expanded variation — _Personal Computer Memory Card International Association_. In this case, the expanded term would be included as the first part of the abbreviation’s entry.

### Shortened terms

Whenever possible, use the longer version of a term for clarity.

_Examples:_

+ Use “telephone” not “phone”
+ Use “operating system” not “system”
+ Use “Newton device” not “Newton”
+ Use “Newton OS” not “NOS”
+ Use “website” not “site”

### Referring to other terms

Generally, “referred to” text should be set as its own paragraph, unless they are part of a longer, more detailed sentence and fit better with the main description text.

_Examples:_

+ Also referred to as …

Use if the referenced term is as common or less common than the source term. In some cases, such as a nickname or alternate spelling, the more personal phrase “Also known as …” can be used.

+ Commonly referred to as …

Use if the referenced term is more common than the source term.

+ Mistakenly referred to as …

Use if the referenced term is an commonly misspelled or mangled version of the source term.

+ Colloquially referred to as …

Use if the referenced term is a quirky or derogatory name for the source term.

### Capitalization of terms

### Indicating menu items, windows, slips, and other named user interface elements

When referring to other terms, as decribed above, if the reference is set in its own paragraph, the term should be capitalized.

_Example:_

+ Also referred to as a [Silk Button](/terms/silk-button).

Other than using their proper capitalized names, such as menu items or buttons, terms can appear in lowercase when set as part of a longer sentence.

_Example:_

+ Ink words are created when the user has selected [Ink Text](/terms/ink-text) in the “Recognition Preferences” [slip](/terms/slip).

### Introducing descriptive elements of a term

Do not use generic nouns such as “kind” when introducing a descriptive element relating to a terms.

_Example:_

+ A kind of flash memory.

Instead, use a more specific noun.

_Examples:_

+ A type of flash memory
+ A method of handwriting recognition
+ A style of font

### Hyphenated terms

Minimize the use of subjective hyphenated terms.

_Examples:_

+ Use “finite state” instead of “finite-state”
+ Use “frontend” instead of “front-end”

Acceptable hyphenated terms include:

+ built-in
+ pen-based
+ software-based
+ subscription-based
+ text-based
+ self-contained
+ user-friendly
+ third-party

### Miscellaneous considerations

When describing the effects of an action, use the more enabling term “can” rather than “may”.

_Example:_

+ A slip where preferences can be adjusted.
+ Only one button can be selected at a time.

### Links to additional information

These guidelines apply whether linking to a live resource or an Internet Archive mirror of the original information.

When linking to the main page of a website, include both the website name and “Website” as part of the link text.

_For example:_

+ [Catamount Software Website](http://catamount.com/)
+ [DNUG Website](https://web.archive.org/web/19990422085721/http://www.dnug.dk/)

When linking to a specific article or resource on a website, use the full name or title of the article or resource — prefixed with the source website — as the link text.

_For example:_

+ [UNNA: The NewtonScript Programming Language](http://www.unna.org/unna/apple/documentation/developer/NewtonScriptProgLanguage.pdf)
+ [Wikipedia: GeoPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPort)
+ [Kunihiro Saito: プログラミング言語 NewtonScript](https://web.archive.org/web/19970712004703/http://www.k-inet.com/~brown/plns.html) (Japanese Translation)

If the link points to a press release, prefix the link text as such.

_For example:_

- [Press Release: Cirrus Logic Debuts Voyager Chipset](https://web.archive.org/web/19980111224604/http://www.cirrus.com/news/archive/fy1997/96.1028p.voyager.html)
- [Press Release: Apple’s New MessagePad 2100](https://web.archive.org/web/19980204041523/http://www.newton-inc.com/press_releases/19971020mp2100.html)
