A community resource of commonly asked questions related to the Newton platform. First published in 1999, the Newton FAQ was originally compiled and maintained by [Steve Weyer](/sources/steve-weyer), Peter Rand, [Sean Luke](/sources/sean-luke), and [Paul Guyot](/sources/paul-guyot). It was updated and posted to various websites and newsgroups on a monthly schedule. In October 2003, [Grant Hutchinson](/sources/grant-hutchinson) took over the maintenance of the document and in February 2021 launched the standalone [Newton FAQ](http://newtonfaq.com/) website.
