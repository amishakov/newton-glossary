A community resource of commonly asked questions related to the Newton platform. First published in 1999, the Newton FAQ was originally compiled and maintained by (link: /sources/steve-weyer text: Steve Weyer), Peter Rand, (link: /sources/sean-luke text: Sean Luke), and (link: /sources/paul-guyot text: Paul Guyot). It was updated and posted to various websites and newsgroups on a monthly schedule. In October 2003, (link: /sources/grant-hutchinson text: Grant Hutchinson) took over the maintenance of the document and in February 2021 launched the standalone [Newton FAQ](http://newtonfaq.com/) website.
