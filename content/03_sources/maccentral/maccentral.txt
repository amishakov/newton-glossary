Launched in September 1995, the Canadian-based MacCentral was one of the first sites to focus on [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and Mac OS news, rumours, and other industry tidbits. MacCentral was purchased by [Mac Publishing LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Publishing) in 2000 and subsequently absorbed into the [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/) website in 2004.
