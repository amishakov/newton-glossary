An monthly magazine initially launched in 1984, changing its name to _MacTutor_ after the second issue. Billed as _The Journal of Apple Technology_, it focused on articles and information targeted at consultants, system administrators, and software developers, rather than end users. In 1989, a separate magazine under the banner of _MacTech_ was launched by the TechAlliance user group. In 1993, MacTutor purchased MacTech and consolidated both publications using the MacTech name.
