A mailing list dedicated to the discussion of the Newton platform and other related products.

Founded in 1997 by Sean Oâ€™Shaughnessy, the list was taken over by [Planet Newton](/terms/planet-newton) in 1999 until a catastrophic server failure in 2001. That same year, [Victor Rehorst](/sources/victor-rehorst) took over the list administration duties, subsequently [handing over the reigns](http://marc.info/?l=newtontalk&m=117493043507410&w=2) to [Grant Hutchinson](/sources/grant-hutchinson) in 2003.

The list is commonly referred to as simply [NTLK](/terms/ntlk).
