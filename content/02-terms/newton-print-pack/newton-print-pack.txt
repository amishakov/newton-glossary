Developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), the Newton Print Pack was originally a serial to parallel adapter with built-in, [ROM](/terms/rom)-based drivers that allowed a user to print from a Newton device to various desktop printers. A later version of the Newton Print Pack was entirely based in software and could be used with third-party adapters and cables. Also referred to as [Print Pack](/terms/print-pack) and [NPP](/terms/npp).
