A system [freeze](/terms/freeze) common in early [MessagePad](/terms/messagepad) devices caused by a lack of adequate [heap space](/terms/heap-space). In later versions of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) this condition notified the user of a problem related to something interacting with a [card](/terms/card) while it was being unmounted, causing the [operating system](/terms/operating-system) to become unresponsive.

Also referred to as [G.O.D.](/terms/GOD) and [The Grip](/terms/the-grip).
