A prototype device developed by [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/) that was positioned as an “all-in-one communication terminal” that combined several communication services including wireless telephony, fax, voice messaging, web access, and email. The @net was based on the [Siemens Online Terminal](/terms/siemens-online-terminal), but used a modified version of Windows CE instead of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) as the [operating system](/terms/operating-system).
